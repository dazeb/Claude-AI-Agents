## 🎯 Start Here: The Project Initializer

> ⚠️ **CRITICAL FIRST STEP**: Always begin with the [**Project Initializer**](.claude/agents/engineering/project-initializer.md) agent. It's the foundation that makes all other agents effective.

### Why Start with the Initializer?

The **Project Initializer** creates the essential infrastructure that allows agents to work across multiple sessions without losing context:

- 📋 **`tests.json`** - A machine-readable roadmap of 50-200+ micro-features
- 🔧 **`init.sh`** - Automated environment setup (no more "setup toil")
- 📝 **`claude-progress.txt`** - Session memory tracking decisions and rationale
- 🗂️ **Project structure** - Organized folders, configs, and documentation

### 🚀 Example Starter Prompts

Copy these prompts to get started with different project types:

#### 1. **Full-Stack Web Application**
```
Use the @project-initializer agent to scaffold a new Next.js 14 e-commerce platform
with the following requirements:
- User authentication (email/password + OAuth)
- Product catalog with search and filtering
- Shopping cart and checkout with Stripe
- Admin dashboard for inventory management
- PostgreSQL database with Prisma ORM

Create a comprehensive tests.json with 80+ granular features broken down into
atomic units (auth, products, cart, checkout, admin). Include init.sh for
dependency installation and dev server startup. Generate initial claude-progress.txt
documenting the architecture decisions.
```

#### 2. **API Service / Backend**
```
Use the @project-initializer agent to create a new REST API service in Python (FastAPI)
for a social media analytics platform:
- JWT authentication with refresh tokens
- User management and permissions (RBAC)
- Social media account integration (Twitter, Instagram APIs)
- Analytics data collection and aggregation
- WebSocket real-time updates
- PostgreSQL + Redis for caching

Generate tests.json with 60+ features covering all endpoints, authentication flows,
data processing pipelines, and edge cases. Create init.sh with venv setup,
dependency installation, and database migrations. Document API design decisions
in claude-progress.txt.
```

#### 3. **Mobile App (React Native)**
```
Use the @project-initializer agent to scaffold a new React Native fitness tracking app:
- User onboarding and profile setup
- Activity tracking (steps, workouts, nutrition)
- Social features (friends, challenges, leaderboard)
- Push notifications and reminders
- Offline-first architecture with local storage sync
- Integration with Apple Health / Google Fit

Create tests.json with 70+ micro-features including onboarding flows, data sync logic,
UI components, and edge cases. Include init.sh for Expo setup and initial
dependencies. Generate claude-progress.txt with mobile-specific architecture decisions
(state management, navigation, offline strategy).
```

## 🧠 Philosophy: Why Long-Running Agents?

Traditional AI agents fail on complex projects because they try to "one-shot" everything. As conversations grow, they hit critical limitations:

| ❌ Traditional Approach | ✅ Long-Running Agents |
|---|---|
| Context loss after 50+ messages | Persistent state in `tests.json` |
| Forgets initial architecture decisions | Design intent in `claude-progress.txt` |
| Degraded code quality over time | Fresh context per atomic feature |
| New sessions start from scratch | Orientation protocol recovers state |
| Overwhelmed by project complexity | Incremental, focused implementation |

### The Solution: State-First Development

Instead of keeping everything in chat history (which gets forgotten), we externalize state to the filesystem:

```
your-project/
├── tests.json              # ← The roadmap (50-200+ features)
├── init.sh                 # ← One-command environment setup
├── claude-progress.txt     # ← Session memory (decisions & rationale)
├── src/                    # ← Your actual code
└── .git/                   # ← Version control for verification
```

> 💡 **Key Insight**: A feature isn't "done" until the agent runs verification, commits to git, and updates `tests.json`. This forces test-driven, incremental progress.

---

## 🔄 How Long-Running Agents Work

### 1. 🎬 The Orientation Protocol

Every time a new agent session starts (or context refreshes), the agent follows a strict startup routine:

```bash
# Agent starts session with:
pwd                              # Confirm workspace
git log -3 --oneline            # Recent changes
cat claude-progress.txt          # Recover design intent
cat tests.json | head -50       # See roadmap status
./init.sh                        # Ensure environment ready
```

**Why this matters**: Takes 10 seconds but prevents the agent from:
- ❌ Re-asking questions already answered
- ❌ Making redundant file searches
- ❌ Violating architectural decisions from previous sessions

---

### 2. 🧩 Atomic Feature Implementation

Complex features are broken into **Atomic Units** in `tests.json`:

```json
{
  "feature": "User Authentication",
  "atomic_units": [
    {"id": 1, "task": "Create User model with email/password fields", "passes": true},
    {"id": 2, "task": "Implement password hashing with bcrypt", "passes": true},
    {"id": 3, "task": "Create POST /auth/register endpoint", "passes": false},
    {"id": 4, "task": "Add email validation middleware", "passes": false},
    {"id": 5, "task": "Write integration tests for registration flow", "passes": false}
  ]
}
```

**The Worker Agent Process**:
1. ✅ Read `claude-progress.txt` (what was done last session)
2. ✅ Run `init.sh` (ensure environment ready)
3. ✅ Implement **exactly ONE** atomic unit (e.g., task #3)
4. ✅ Run verification (tests, manual checks)
5. ✅ Commit to git with descriptive message
6. ✅ Update `tests.json` → `"passes": true`
7. ✅ Update `claude-progress.txt` (document decisions)

> 🎯 **Result**: High-quality code with focused context. Each session uses "early tokens" for implementation, not fighting cluttered memory.

---

### 3. 📊 State Persistence Strategy

| Artifact | Purpose | Format | Updated By |
|----------|---------|--------|------------|
| `tests.json` | Feature roadmap & status | JSON | Worker agents (passes: true/false) |
| `init.sh` | Environment automation | Shell script | Initializer (once), refined by workers |
| `claude-progress.txt` | Design intent & decisions | Markdown | Every agent session |
| `.git/` | Code verification | Git commits | After each atomic unit completion |

> 💡 **Pro Tip**: These files are your "source of truth". Any agent can recover full project state by reading them, even months later.

## 💡 Usage Patterns & Best Practices

### Pattern 1: The Perfect Session Start

Every agent session should begin with orientation:

```markdown
# Before implementing anything:
1. Read claude-progress.txt (what was done last)
2. Check tests.json (which features are pending)
3. Run init.sh (ensure environment ready)
4. Implement ONE atomic unit
5. Verify, commit, update tests.json
6. Document decisions in claude-progress.txt
```

> 🎯 **Why**: This prevents wasted tokens on "What's the current state?" questions.

---

### Pattern 2: Feature Decomposition

Break big features into 5-10 atomic units:

```json
❌ Bad (too large):
{
  "id": 1,
  "task": "Implement complete user authentication system",
  "passes": false
}

✅ Good (atomic):
{
  "id": 1, "task": "Create User model schema", "passes": true
},
{
  "id": 2, "task": "Implement password hashing", "passes": true
},
{
  "id": 3, "task": "Create /register endpoint", "passes": false
},
{
  "id": 4, "task": "Add JWT token generation", "passes": false
},
{
  "id": 5, "task": "Create /login endpoint", "passes": false
}
```

> 💡 **Rule of Thumb**: If a task takes >30 minutes, break it down further.

---

### Pattern 3: Agent Collaboration

Multiple agents can work together on complex features:

```markdown
# Example: Building a payment system

1. @Backend Architect
   → Design payment API contract and database schema
   → Document in claude-progress.txt

2. @Frontend Developer
   → Build payment form UI with validation
   → Integrate with API contract

3. @API Tester
   → Write contract tests for payment endpoints
   → Test auth boundaries and edge cases

4. @DevOps Automator
   → Set up Stripe webhook handling in production
   → Configure environment variables and secrets
```

---

### Pattern 4: Managing Long Sessions

When working across many features, refresh context to maintain code quality:

```markdown
## Session Management Strategy

**When to use `/clear`**:
- After completing 3-4 atomic units
- When context feels cluttered
- Before switching to a different feature area
- After any extended debugging session

**Recovery after `/clear`**:
1. Agent reads claude-progress.txt (recovers session memory)
2. Agent checks tests.json (sees completed vs. pending work)
3. Agent runs init.sh (verifies environment)
4. Ready to continue with fresh, focused context

**Result**: Better code quality with focused attention on current task
```

> 🎯 **Why**: Fresh context = sharper reasoning. State files ensure no information loss.

---

### Pattern 5: Triggering Extended Thinking

For complex decisions, explicitly request extended thinking:

```markdown
## Extended Thinking Triggers

Use these phrases to activate deeper reasoning:

**"think"** - Basic extended thinking
Example: "Think about the best database schema for this feature"

**"think hard"** - Deeper analysis
Example: "Think hard about the trade-offs between microservices vs. monolith"

**"think harder"** - Complex problem solving
Example: "Think harder about why these tests are flaky using 5 Whys"

**"ultrathink"** - Maximum depth reasoning
Example: "Ultrathink about the full TCO analysis for build vs. buy"

## Best Use Cases by Agent

- **Backend Architect**: Architecture decisions, scaling strategies
- **AI Engineer**: RAG pipeline design, prompt optimization
- **Test Results Analyzer**: Root cause analysis of complex failures
- **Tool Evaluator**: Build vs. buy decisions, vendor selection
- **Performance Benchmarker**: Bottleneck identification, optimization paths
- **Growth Hacker**: Multi-variate experiment design
```

> 💡 **Pro Tip**: Extended thinking is most valuable for decisions with multiple trade-offs or non-obvious solutions.

---

### Pattern 6: Testing Agent Effectiveness

Before deploying agents to your team, measure their impact:

```markdown
## Agent Evaluation Framework

**1. Create 3 Test Scenarios**

Example for @Frontend Developer:
- Scenario 1: "Build a login form with email/password validation"
- Scenario 2: "Create a responsive dashboard with 4 metric cards"
- Scenario 3: "Fix accessibility issues in the checkout flow"

**2. Measure Baseline (Without Agent)**

Run each scenario with Claude (no agent loaded):
- Time to completion
- Code quality (subjective 1-5 rating)
- Required iterations
- Adherence to project patterns

**3. Measure With Agent (Agent Loaded)**

Run same scenarios with agent:
- Did agent activate correctly?
- Time to completion vs. baseline
- Code quality vs. baseline
- Did agent follow project conventions?
- Were there any hallucinations or mistakes?

**4. Calculate Impact**

Improvements to look for:
- ✅ Faster time to completion (20-50% faster)
- ✅ Better code quality (fewer revisions needed)
- ✅ Consistent adherence to project patterns
- ✅ Correct tool/library selection
- ✅ Proper error handling and edge cases

**5. Iterate Based on Results**

If agent underperforms:
- Add missing context to agent definition
- Include more specific examples
- Clarify success criteria in "When to Use" section
- Update tools/technologies section
```

> 🎯 **Goal**: Agents should provide 20-50% improvement in quality and speed for their specialized tasks.

## ⚡ Claude 4.5 Optimizations

These agents leverage Claude 4.5's unique capabilities:

### 🔀 Parallel Tool Use
Agents read multiple files and run searches simultaneously:
```markdown
✅ Do this:
- Read 5 files in parallel
- Run 3 grep searches simultaneously
- Analyze multiple code paths at once

❌ Not this:
- Read file 1 → wait → read file 2 → wait → read file 3
```

### 🎨 Anti-AI-Slop Guidelines
Frontend agents enforce distinctive design:
- ✅ Unique typography combinations (not default system fonts)
- ✅ Cohesive color palettes (not generic blue/gray)
- ✅ Staggered micro-interactions (not uniform animations)
- ❌ Generic "Bootstrap-looking" designs

### 🧠 Extended Thinking
Complex decisions use Claude's extended thinking mode:
- Architecture design (Backend Architect)
- Root cause analysis (Test Results Analyzer)
- Build vs. buy decisions (Tool Evaluator)
- Multi-source data synthesis (Analytics Reporter)

### 🔍 Anti-Hallucination Guardrails
Strict verification protocols:
- ✅ Must read file before discussing contents
- ✅ Must verify changes with git diff
- ✅ Must run tests before marking features complete
- ✅ Must update tests.json only after verification
