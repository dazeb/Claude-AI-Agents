## 🚀 Quick Start After Installation

### Step 1: Start with Project Initializer (CRITICAL!)

```bash
# In Claude Code or OpenCode, say:
@project-initializer, create a Next.js e-commerce app with authentication,
product catalog, shopping cart, and Stripe integration. Use PostgreSQL.
```

The Project Initializer creates:
- `tests.json` - Feature roadmap and tracking
- `init.sh` - One-command environment setup
- `claude-progress.txt` - Long-term memory across sessions

### Step 2: Use Specialized Agents

```bash
# Frontend work
@react-nextjs-specialist, build a responsive navbar with mobile menu

# API integration
@api-integration-specialist, connect to Stripe API with error handling

# Performance issues
@web-performance-optimizer, improve my Lighthouse score to 95+

# Styling
@css-tailwind-expert, create a design system with dark mode
```

### Step 3: Verify Installation

**Check installed agents:**
```bash
# Claude Code
ls .claude/agents/

# OpenCode
ls .opencode/agent/
```

**Read an agent:**
```bash
# Claude Code
cat .claude/agents/web-development/react-nextjs-specialist.md

# OpenCode
cat .opencode/agent/web-development/react-nextjs-specialist.md
```

## 💡 Installation Tips

### Tip 1: Start Small
Don't install all 43 agents at once. Start with:
- **Project Initializer** (essential)
- **Web Development** (if doing web work)
- Add more categories as needed

### Tip 2: Use Git Submodules for Teams
If working in a team, use git submodules so everyone has the same agent versions:
```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/dazeb/ClaudePlaybook.git .claude
git commit -m "Add Claude AI Agents"
```

### Tip 3: Keep Agents Updated
Check for updates monthly:
```bash
cd .claude && git pull origin main
```

### Tip 4: Customize for Your Team
Fork the repository and customize agents for your stack:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dazeb/ClaudePlaybook.git my-custom-agents
# Edit agents to match your needs
# Install from your fork
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "command not found: curl"
**Solution:** Install curl or use git clone:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dazeb/ClaudePlaybook.git .claude
```

### Issue: Agents not showing up in Claude Code
**Solution:** Make sure the directory structure is correct:
```bash
ls .claude/agents/  # Should show folders
```

### Issue: OpenCode can't find agents
**Solution:** Verify folder names are correct:
- Should be `.opencode/agent/` (singular "agent", not "agents")
- Run the installer again and select "OpenCode"

### Issue: Permission denied running installer
**Solution:** Make it executable:
```bash
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```
