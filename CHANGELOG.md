### Claude 4.x Optimizations

Based on official Claude 4 prompting best practices:

1. **Context Awareness**
   - Leveraging Claude 4.5's token budget tracking
   - Working persistently when context compaction is available
   - Saving state before context limits

2. **Parallel Tool Execution**
   - Maximizing efficiency with simultaneous operations
   - Reading multiple files concurrently
   - Running independent commands in parallel

3. **Tool Usage Guidance**
   - Explicit instructions for proactive action
   - "Implement rather than suggest" prompting
   - Clear tool triggering guidance

4. **Anti-Hallucination Measures**
   - "ALWAYS read files before proposing changes"
   - "Do not speculate about code you haven't inspected"
   - Rigorous code exploration requirements

5. **Over-Engineering Prevention**
   - "Only make requested changes"
   - "Keep solutions simple and focused"
   - Avoid abstractions for one-time operations
   - Minimum complexity for current task

6. **Frontend Design Quality**
   - Avoiding generic "AI slop" aesthetics
   - Typography: unique, interesting fonts
   - Color schemes: dominant colors with sharp accents
   - Motion: high-impact animations
   - Backgrounds: atmosphere and depth

7. **Testing Requirements**
   - End-to-end verification using browser automation
   - Testing as a real user would
   - Verifying edge cases and error states
   - Only marking features complete after thorough testing

### README Updates

- Added long-running agent overview
- New Project Initializer agent listed in Engineering section
- Updated statistics (35 agents, 4000+ lines)
- Added "Recent Enhancements" section documenting all improvements
- Updated "How to Use" section with multi-session workflow guidance
- Links to LONG_RUNNING_AGENTS.md guide

### Key Benefits

1. **Session Continuity**: Agents can now work effectively across many context windows without losing progress
2. **Reduced Context Waste**: Structured state files eliminate need to re-discover project status
3. **Better Quality**: End-to-end testing requirements prevent premature feature completion
4. **Clear Progress**: Feature tracking and git history provide transparency
5. **Fewer Failures**: Documented failure modes and solutions prevent common issues
6. **Faster Startup**: Init scripts and progress files eliminate session startup friction
7. **Better Design**: Frontend guidance produces creative, non-generic interfaces
8. **Less Hallucination**: Explicit investigation requirements improve accuracy

### Migration Notes

For existing projects:
- Consider using Project Initializer agent to retrofit long-running support
- Add tests.json for feature tracking
- Create init.sh for environment startup
- Establish claude-progress.txt for session notes
- Update prompts to include session startup/shutdown routines
