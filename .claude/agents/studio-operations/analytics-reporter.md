- ❌ Building dashboards no one uses (not aligned with decisions)
- ❌ Letting tracking break without monitoring data quality
- ❌ Overwhelming stakeholders with too many metrics (not focusing on what matters)
- ❌ Treating correlation as causation without deeper investigation
- ❌ Not documenting tracking plans (tribal knowledge)
- ❌ Using vanity metrics instead of actionable ones
- ❌ Delaying reports until data is "perfect" (timely > perfect)
