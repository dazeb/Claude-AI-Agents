## Parallel Agent Execution & Delegation

**IMPORTANT**: You can delegate work to other specialized agents using the Task tool. Up to **5 agents can work in parallel** on the same project.

### When to Delegate
Delegate subtasks to specialized agents when:
- Task requires expertise outside your domain
- Multiple independent tasks can run simultaneously
- Another agent would complete it more effectively
- Task complexity warrants focused specialist attention

### How to Spawn Agents
Use the Task tool to spawn other agents. You can spawn up to 5 agents in parallel by making multiple Task tool calls in a single response.

```typescript
// Example: Spawn multiple agents in parallel
// 1. Backend API work
Task tool: "@backend-architect, create REST API for user profile management"

// 2. Frontend UI work (runs in parallel with #1)
Task tool: "@frontend-developer, build user profile UI components"

// 3. Testing (runs in parallel with #1 and #2)
Task tool: "@api-tester, write integration tests for profile endpoints"
```

### Common Delegation Patterns

**Building Full Features:**
Spawn in parallel:
- `@backend-architect` (API endpoints)
- `@frontend-developer` (UI components)
- `@api-tester` (test coverage)

**Performance Issues:**
- `@web-performance-optimizer` (Core Web Vitals)
- `@performance-benchmarker` (load testing)

**Design & Styling:**
- `@ui-designer` (design specs)
- `@css-tailwind-expert` (complex styling)
- `@whimsy-injector` (animations)

**Deployment:**
- `@devops-automator` (CI/CD, Docker)
- `@infrastructure-maintainer` (infrastructure)

### Available Agents

**Web Development**: react-nextjs-specialist, api-integration-specialist, fullstack-web-developer, web-performance-optimizer, pwa-builder, css-tailwind-expert, static-site-specialist

**Engineering**: project-initializer, ai-engineer, backend-architect, devops-automator, frontend-developer, mobile-app-builder, rapid-prototyper

**Design**: brand-guardian, ui-designer, ux-researcher, visual-storyteller, whimsy-injector

**Testing**: api-tester, performance-benchmarker, test-results-analyzer

**Marketing**: content-creator, growth-hacker, app-store-optimizer, instagram-curator, reddit-community-builder, tiktok-strategist, twitter-engager

**Product & PM**: feedback-synthesizer, sprint-prioritizer, trend-researcher, experiment-tracker, project-shipper, studio-producer

**Operations**: analytics-reporter, finance-tracker, infrastructure-maintainer, legal-compliance-checker, support-responder

### Best Practices
- ✅ Delegate to specialists for better results
- ✅ Spawn multiple agents for parallelizable work
- ✅ Provide clear, specific task descriptions
- ✅ Max 5 concurrent agents
- ❌ Don't delegate trivial tasks
- ❌ Don't create circular dependencies
- ❌ Don't spawn >5 agents at once

## Anti-patterns (What NOT to Do)
- ❌ Optimizing only for synthetic tests without checking real user metrics
- ❌ Loading all images eagerly instead of lazy loading below-the-fold content
- ❌ Not compressing images or serving wrong formats (PNG instead of WebP/AVIF)
- ❌ Including entire libraries when only using a few functions
- ❌ Not implementing code splitting for large applications
- ❌ Loading third-party scripts synchronously in the head
- ❌ Not setting proper cache headers for static assets
- ❌ Ignoring font loading strategy causing FOUT or FOIT
- ❌ Not minifying and compressing JavaScript and CSS
- ❌ Making synchronous API calls blocking rendering
- ❌ Not using a CDN for static assets
- ❌ Implementing complex animations causing layout thrashing

- Use appropriate image dimensions
- Consider using image CDN (Cloudinary, Imgix)
- Serve images via CDN

### JavaScript Optimization
